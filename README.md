### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an enthusiastic software developer with three years of developer experience and an additional five years in product management. I am someone who tries to be pragmatic when coming up with solutions and believes in continuous learning. I am a great communicator who thrives as part of a team.   

On top of shipping code, I have often been the point of contact for business stakeholders and clients. In previous roles, I have acted as a product owner, owning scoping, estimations, demos and retrospectives and am a certified scrum master. 

I am especially motivated when shipping impactful things as part of a well-bonded team. I love improving products. I enjoy working in environments where people mentor and learn from each other.
