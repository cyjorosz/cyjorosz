I am a frontend engineer with a background in product management. I am business-driven and pragmatic when coming up with solutions. I am a great communicator and thrive as part of a team.

I am most hands-on with the modern Javascript stack (ES6), TypeScript,CSS in JS (styled-components). On top of shipping code, I have often been the point of contact for business stakeholders and clients. In previous roles, I have acted as a product owner, owning scoping, estimations, demos and retrospectives and am a certified scrum master.

I am especially motivated when shipping impactful things as part of a well-bonded team. I love improving products. I enjoy working in environments where people mentor and learn from each other.
